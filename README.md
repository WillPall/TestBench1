Some terrain generation and visualisation algorithms I am playing with.

GPU raycaster is based on work by these guys: http://wwwcg.in.tum.de/en/research/research/publications/2009/gpu-ray-casting-for-scalable-terrain-rendering.html
Raycaster box intersection stolen from a DirectX SDK sample.
Multi-dimensional Simplex Noise by Stefan Gustavson, converted to C# by me.
The tileable 2D noise idea came from http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/a/23639/13376
